# What is love? KISK Summer School 2022

The theme of digital memory and capturing emotions is somehow important to me. I use digital artifacts for this. They're easy to share, simple to revisit, and I have this feeling that they won't get lost as easily as a photo or a sketchbook.

This is a description of a micro-project that isn't particularly interesting from a technical standpoint, but it's a sweet little thing.

At [KISK](https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/) Summer School, [Lea](https://leabelejova.wixsite.com/portfolio) decided to go around to all the participants and ask them quite simply: "What is love?" I'm still not entirely sure what her intention was. But I'm convinced that the environment in which it took place lent itself to a light magic.

Summer is beginning, the semester is ending, you're in beautiful nature, somewhat cut off from the world. Around you are forests and high cliffs, a river murmurs. There are friends here, or at least people with whom you share a few common interests. And you're spending a whole week here. I wouldn't dare claim whether some kind of self-reflection happens here, but relaxation certainly does. And then someone asks you: "What is love?"

The collected answers are cheerful, funny, a bit philosophical, loving, brief and extensive, some perhaps slightly bitter. I don't remember exactly how it all happened and who approached whom, but Lea and I agreed to create a digital artifact and immortalize the answers by releasing them into the internet.

## Technology

Now for the less poetic part. Lea prepared graphics in Canva, and I put together a simple website where you can view the answers. Nicely one after another, similar to when you walk around to individual people. Just a bit of HTML, CSS, and simple JavaScript. We added chirping birds to the background. And that's it.

The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RadekDobrovolny/laska) and is also hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://radekdobrovolny.github.io/laska/). Happy browsing.
