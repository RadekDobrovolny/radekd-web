This resumé is a blend of 
the technologies I've worked with and includes links to articles about projects 
where I've used these skills. I hope you find it helpful!

# programming

Right now, my main focus is on data engineering. I also have a lot of 
experience with backend development of web applications. 
Occasionally, I do frontend for small projects or just for fun (like this website).

## python

__basics:__ numbers, bools, conditions, strings, comparisons, 
lists, loops, tuples, dicts, sets, classes

__advanced:__ list/dicts comprehension, iterators, generators, 
fixtures, decorators

__libs:__ datetime, unittest, pytest, os, sys, dataclasses, abc, 
itertools, functools, json, re, logging, pathlib, csv, math

__complex libs:__ flask, requests, pandas, numpy, pygame, pillow, 
sqlalchemy, asyncio, turtle, reportlab

__style:__ flake8, isort, black, pylint

__to learn list:__ metaclasses, celery

## django

Starting projects, managing app, URL routing, design models, views, 
migrations, templates, forms, authentication, i18n.

I've built an in-production CRM for small business by myself.

__to learn list:__ middleware, django REST framework, signals

## git

__commands:__ clone, pull, push, commit, rebase, branch, merge, 
checkout, stash, log, diff, remote, squash

__storage:__ GitHub, Gitlab, bitbucket

__to learn list:__ hooks, cherry-pick, reflog, submodules

## javascript

Functions, arrays, objects, conditionals, loops, DOM manipulation, event handling.

I've written several short scripts that work with the DOM on web pages.

I also have some experience with p5.js.

__to learn list:__ ES6+ features, single page apps frameworks

## databases

I've primarily relied on fundamental SQL queries in my work. 
From time to time, I've designed databases with no more than 20 tables.

I usually work with SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

I've also met ElasticSearch, Redis or Aerospike at work.

__to learn list:__ get more familiar with caching and in-memory DBs.

# operations & cloud

I have more of a developer background in this area. I have never 
designed larger architectures or installed systems, and that is not my 
goal either. 

I built a bare-metal home NAS where I run several services, primarily using Docker.

## docker

Working with containers, writing dockerfiles, using docker-compose to connect 
multiple services in a single environment.

## kubernetes

Rudimentary understanding of node, service, job, cronjob and pod principles.
Deploy containers to kubernetes, writing manifests, checking pods and logs.

Using tools like kubectl and k9s.

## CI/CD

Creating and editing simple actions on GitHub, Gitlab or Jenkins.

## AWS

A new field for me. I'm learning the basics. IAM, Lambda, SNS, EKS. 
I'm learning to write configurations in Terraform.
