This resumé is a blend of
the technologies I've worked with and includes links to articles about projects
where I've used these skills. I hope you find it helpful!

Right now, my main focus is on data engineering. I also have a lot of
experience with backend development of web applications.
Occasionally, I do frontend for small projects or just for fun (like this website).

# backend

## python

- design and maintenance of production REST APIs (Flask, FastAPI, Django)
- async / await, practical use of asyncio
- dataclasses, typing, abstract base classes
- decorators (logging, authentication, retries, timing)
- error handling and exception management
- ORM usage
- testing with pytest (mocking, fixtures, parametrization, edge cases)
- code quality tooling: ruff, black, isort

**libs:** FastAPI, Flask, Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Requests, Pandas, NumPy

**learning / next focus:** Celery (distributed background tasks), advanced asyncio patterns, metaclasses

## Django

- development and maintenance of Django-based web applications
- project and app structure, URL routing
- views, middleware basics
- data modeling, Django ORM, migrations
- Django REST API (serializers, views, basic permissions)
- authentication and authorization
- templates, integration of CSS frameworks (Bulma, Tailwind)
- forms, validation, admin usage and customization
- i18n
- debugging and maintaining existing codebases

**production experience:**
- built and maintained a Django-based CRM for a small business  
- involved in application design, implementation, and ongoing maintenance

**learning / next focus:** background tasks, performance tuning (query optimization, N+1 problems)

## databases

- practical use of SQL in application development
- writing and maintaining SQL queries
- database schema design
- experience with both relational and non-relational databases

**relational:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite 

**non-relational:** MongoDB, Elasticsearch

**in-memory:** Redis

**learning / next focus:** caching strategies and in-memory data stores

# web technologies

## JavaScript

Functions, arrays, objects, conditionals, loops, DOM manipulation, event handling.

I've written several short scripts that work with the DOM on web pages.

__libs:__ jQuery, Swiper, p5

__to learn list:__ ES6+ features, single page apps frameworks

## frontend

# infrastructure & cloud

I have more of a developer background in this area. I have never
designed larger architectures or installed systems, and that is not my
goal either.

I built a bare-metal home NAS where I run several services, primarily using Docker.

Creating and editing simple actions on GitHub, Gitlab or Jenkins.

## git

__commands:__ init, clone, pull, push, commit, rebase, branch, merge,
checkout, stash, log, diff, remote, squash, cherry-pick

__storage:__ GitHub, Gitlab, bitbucket

__to learn list:__ hooks, reflog, submodules

## docker

Working with containers, writing dockerfiles, using docker-compose to connect
multiple services in a single environment.

Portainer for managing docker containers.

## kubernetes

Rudimentary understanding of node, service, job, cronjob and pod principles.
Deploy containers to kubernetes, writing manifests, checking pods and logs.

Using tools like kubectl and k9s.

## AWS

A new field for me. I'm learning the basics. IAM, Lambda, SNS, EKS.
I'm learning to write configurations in Terraform.

# engineering practices

- code reviews
- pair programming
